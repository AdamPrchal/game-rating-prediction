        ## Data Collection ðŸ“Š
    </header>

    In this project, we used data from SteamDB to find and classify the highest-rated and lowest-rated games from the past three years. Here are the steps we followed for our data collection:

    ### Data Source and Criteria

    1. **Using SteamDB**: We got data from SteamDB, which is a big database for Steam games. We collected the top 200 best-rated and 200 worst-rated games from the last three years. This way, we based our analysis on recent data.

    2. **Selecting Key Information**: While getting data, we collected important details like game names and their Steam IDs. These IDs were important for getting more data later.

    ### Fetching Steam Reviews

    To analyze game reviews from Steam, we needed user reviews for the games we identified using their Steam IDs. Here is how we got these reviews:

    1. **Collecting Reviews**: Using the Steam API, we got user reviews for each game we found on SteamDB. This included the content of reviews, dates, and user ratings.

    2. **Ensuring Data Quality**: We made sure the reviews we collected were complete and from different dates to give us a good mix of user opinions.

    ### Summary of Steps

    1. **Scraping SteamDB**: We started by getting a list of games and their Steam IDs from SteamDB based on their ratings over the past three years.
    
    2. **Review Collection**: With the Steam IDs, we used the Steam API to get user reviews for each game. This gave us a rich dataset for text mining and sentiment analysis.

    ### Statistics

    - **Number of Reviews Collected**: We collected a total of 32,000 reviews for the top-rated games and 23,000 reviews for the worst-rated games.
