In the fast-changing and competitive video game industry, predicting the success of games is important. In our previous machine learning project, we focused on predicting video game ratings. Now, for our text mining course, we want to expand on this by analyzing game reviews from the Steam API using classification and clustering models.

**Steam** is a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation, where users can purchase, download, and review video games. It is one of the largest platforms for PC gaming and provides a vast amount of user-generated reviews, making it an excellent source for our analysis.

The goal of this project is to compare the highest-rated and lowest-rated games. Using reviews from Steam, we will perform text mining to find key factors and sentiments that separate successful games from unsuccessful ones. We will follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Get reviews for the highest-rated and lowest-rated games using the Steam API.

2. **Text Representation**:
   - Represent the reviews using methods like Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and word embeddings.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Analyze the sentiment of the reviews to understand overall positive or negative feelings.

4. **Text Classification and Clustering**:
   - Develop models to classify and group the reviews based on their content and sentiments.

5. **Feature Analysis**:
   - Analyze features such as genre, platforms, developers, and gameplay duration to see how they affect game ratings.

By using existing data and text mining techniques, we aim to understand what makes a game successful or not. This project will improve our skills in text mining and natural language processing and offer useful insights for the gaming industry.
