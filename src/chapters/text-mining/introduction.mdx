In the fast-changing and competitive video game industry, understanding what makes a game successful is very important. In our last machine learning project, we tried to predict video game ratings. Now, in our text mining course, we want to go further by analyzing game reviews from the Steam API using different text mining techniques.

**Steam** is a digital platform made by Valve Corporation where people can buy, download, and review video games. It is one of the biggest platforms for PC gaming and has many user reviews, making it a great source for our analysis.

The goal of this project is to compare the best-rated and worst-rated games. Using reviews from Steam, we will do text mining to find key factors that make games successful or not. We will follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection:**
  - Collect reviews for the best-rated and worst-rated games using the Steam API.

2. **Text Representation:**
  - Change the raw text data into formats that we can analyze (e.g., tokenization, lemmatization).

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Use sentiment analysis to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

4. **Classification:**
  - Use classification models to tell the difference between reviews of highly-rated and low-rated games.

5. **Final Summary**

By using existing data and text mining techniques, we want to understand better what makes a game succeed or fail. This project helps us improve our skills in text mining and natural language processing, and it also gives valuable insights for the gaming industry.
